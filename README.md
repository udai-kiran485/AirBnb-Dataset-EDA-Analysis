## About AirBnb
Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties or spare rooms to travelers. It connects hosts with guests. You can find a wide range of accommodations on Airbnb, from apartments and houses to more unique offerings like treehouses, boats, or castles. Guests can browse listings,  read reviews from previous visitors, and communicate directly with hosts before booking. Hosts, on the other hand, can set their own prices and availability.

## Overview of the project
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of Airbnb listings to uncover insights that can inform hosts, guests, and even the broader vacation rental market. Through a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will examine key factors influencing listing characteristics, pricing trends, guest reviews, and availability. By visualizing relationships between variables, identifying patterns, and detecting any anomalies or outliers, the goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different factors contribute to the pricing of Airbnb properties.

## Tools and Libraries used:-
- Python 3.13
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Visual Studio Code Editor

## Objectives
- Assess room types, pricing, and availability in various neighborhoods.
- Examine host behaviors and patterns in listing details.
- Spot pricing outliers and unusual trends.
- Offer actionable insights for both guests and hosts.
